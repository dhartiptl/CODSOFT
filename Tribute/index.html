                <br><br> <h1>Ratan Tata Success Story: A New Beginnings at Tata</h1><br>In 1961 after returning to India Ratan Tata joined the Tata Group. His first job involved working with the blue-collar employees at Tata Steel Ltd in Jamshedpur. “It was a total waste of time — I was shuffled around from department to department, but nobody actually told me what to do! I guess, I was looked at as a family member, so no one said anything to me — but I spent 6 months just trying to make myself look ‘useful’,” Tata said. He worked as an apprentice on the shop floor and his responsibilities included shoveling limestone and working with the furnaces.<br>After gaining experience he was promoted to management during the 1970s. He was made director and tasked with leading National Radio and Electronics (NELCO).
                He was able to turn the company around, but the company eventually collapsed during an economic slowdown. In 1977, he was tasked to turn around another troubled company, the Mumbai-based Empress Mills. He succeeded in doing so but the refusal to add investment into the company and the Mumbai textile workers’ strike led by Datta Samant eventually led to its closure in 1986.

The then chairmen  Bill Ford reportedly said to Tata that he was quite out of his depth.<br>An ex-employee of Tata who was presented in the meeting recalls they were told ‘When you do not know anything, why did you start the passenger car division at all’. They said they will do us a favor by buying our car division.<br>The humiliation ended when the group decided to return to New York the same evening. Tata was reportedly somber the whole flight.<br>Tata turned the tide by thriving in the Indian markets. Nine years later Ford was on the verge of bankruptcy after the 2008 global financial meltdown. Tata swooped in and acquired the auto company’s iconic Jaguar Land-Rover brands for $2.3 billion. Ford chairman Bill Ford thanked Ratan Tata, saying “you are doing us a big favor by buying JLR.”
